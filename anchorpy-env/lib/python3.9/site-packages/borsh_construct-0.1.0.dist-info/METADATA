`borsh-construct` is an implementation of the [Borsh](https://borsh.io/) binary serialization format for Python projects.

Borsh stands for Binary Object Representation Serializer for Hashing. It is meant to be used in security-critical projects as it prioritizes consistency, safety, speed, and comes with a strict specification.

Read the [Documentation](https://near.github.io/borsh-construct-py/).
